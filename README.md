# IIT Predictor

The IIT Predictor is a project that aims to predict the chances of admission into the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) based on various factors. This project is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed at [https://github.com/alexravi/IIT-PREDICTOR](https://github.com/alexravi/IIT-PREDICTOR).

## Overview

The IIT Predictor utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical admission data and predict the likelihood of admission for prospective students. By considering factors such as exam scores, category, and other relevant parameters, the predictor provides an estimate of the probability of being admitted to one of the prestigious IITs.

## Features

The IIT Predictor offers the following features:

1. **Data Analysis**: The project includes a comprehensive analysis of historical admission data to identify patterns and trends in the selection process of IITs.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: The predictor employs various machine learning models to train on the historical data and make predictions on the chances of admission.
3. **Prediction Algorithm**: The algorithm uses a combination of features provided by the user, such as exam scores, category, and more, to calculate the probability of admission into IITs.
4. **User Interface**: The project includes a user-friendly interface where users can input their details and obtain their admission probability.
5. **Extensible and Open Source**: The IIT Predictor is an open-source project, allowing users to contribute, enhance, and modify the code as per their requirements.

## Usage
